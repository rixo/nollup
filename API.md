# API Documentation

Nollup follows closely to the API defined by Rollup so that it can be easily swapped.
As of writing this, this API is aligned with ```1.0.0``` of Rollup.

```
async function build () {
    // Prepare instance of nollup
    let bundle = await nollup(inputOptions);

    // Generate code
    let { output } = await bundle.generate(outputOptions);

    // Unlike Rollup, there's no write method.
    // Code should be served from memory.
}

build();
```

### Supported Config Options 

```
input,
output,
plugins,
external,
acornInjectPlugins,
watch - include/exclude
```

### Supported Output Options

```
file, // This is what the entry point will be called when generating.
format, // Format is always 'esm', 'cjs' or 'iife'. No support for other formats.
globals, // Remap global inputs to their window variables.
assetFileNames, // filename pattern for assets
chunkFileNames, // filename pattern for chunks
entryFileNames, // filename pattern for entries
```

**Note:** ```[hash]``` is not converted. This is intentional so that the generated
files can be easily referenced using files such as ```index.html```. For building,
it's recommend to use [rollup-plugin-static-files](https://github.com/PepsRyuu/rollup-plugin-static-files)
which will automatically inject the hash values Rollup generates into your HTML files.

### Methods

***void* invalidate(*String* file)**

Sets a flag in memory for the specified file. When ```generate``` is called again
it will see the file has been invalidated and it will re-compile that file.

***Promise&lt;Object&gt;* generate()**

Generates the bundle. Returns a promise which contains an array of objects. The objects will
have the following:

```
{ 
    code, 
    fileName, 
    isEntry,
    isDynamicEntry,
    modules,
    exports
}
``` 
Or if it's an asset:

```
{
    isAsset,
    source,
    fileName
}
```

### Environment Variables

When using the CLI, the following environment variables are present:

* ```process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH```
* ```process.env.NOLLUP```

### Plugin Hooks

[Rollup plugins](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#plugins-overview) should work. 

The following lifecycle methods have been implemented:

```
buildStart,
buildEnd,
options,
outputOptions,
intro,
outro,
banner,
footer,
generateBundle,
resolveDynamicImport,
resolveId,
load,
transform,
renderChunk,
renderError,
renderStart,
resolveFileUrl,
resolveImportMeta
```

### Plugin Context

See [Rollup Plugin Context](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#context) for more information.
Plugins can use the following methods in their lifecycle methods.

```
this.meta
```

```
this.addWatchFile(filepath)
```

```
this.emitFile(file)
```

```
this.getFileName(id)
```

```
this.parse(code, acornOptions)
```

```
this.warn(warning)
```

```
this.error(error)
```

```
this.emitAsset(assetName, source)
```

```
this.getAssetFileName(assetId)
```

```
this.emitChunk(id, options)
```

```
this.getChunkFileName(chunkId)
```

```
this.setAssetSource(assetId, source);
```

```
this.resolveId(importee, importer)
```

```
this.getCombinedSourcemap()
```

```
this.getModuleInfo(moduleId)
```

```
this.moduleIds
```

```
this.resolve(importee, importer, opts)
```



### Custom Plugin Hooks

To enable functionality such as HMR, custom nollup plugin hooks have been implemented 

***String* nollupBundleInit()**

Injected into the bundle before the first module in the bundle is required.
It has access to ```instances``` and ```modules```.

```instances``` is an array of instantiated modules. Each module has the following properties:

* ***Number* id -** The ID of the module that it was instantiated from.
* ***Object* exports -** Export code from the module.
* ***Array<Number>* dependencies -** Module IDs this module depends on.
* ***Boolean* invalidate -** If set to true, the module will be invalidated and executed again when required.

```modules``` is an object of module IDs with their code.

***String* nollupModuleInit()**

Injected into the bundle before a module is instantiated.  
It has access to ```instances```, ```modules``` and ```module``` which is the module being instantiated.

***String* nollupModuleWrap()**

Wrap a module instantiation code with additional code. 
Useful for libraries providing Hot Module Replacement and need to add commonly functionality to all modules.
It has access to ```instances```, ```modules``` and ```module``` which is the module being wrapped.

## Dev Middleware

The dev middleware wraps Nollup bundling, and provides Hot Module Replacement, for ExpressJS servers. It watches for changes to the directory, and on any change, it will invalidate and regenerate the bundle.

```
let nollupDevServer = require('nollup/lib/dev-middleware');
let config = require('./rollup.config.js');

// Your express code

app.use(nollupDevServer(app, config, {
    watch: './src',
    hot: true,
    verbose: false
}));

```

### Dev Middleware Options

* ***String* watch -** Directory to watch for changes in order to rebuild.
* ***Boolean* hot -** If true, Hot Module Replacement will be enabled and injected into the bundle.
* ***Boolean* verbose -** If true, will print status of HMR to developer console.
* ***String* hmrHost -** Host to connect to for HMR. Default is ```window.location.host```.
* ***String* contentBase -** Path to public content. Used for resolving ```file``` path correctly.

## Hot Module Replacement

When HMR is enabled, JS files in the project can access ```module.hot```. 
It provides the following methods:

***void* accept(*Function* callback)**

Executes when the current module, or a dependency has been replaced.
Passes ```e``` argument which an object containing information about the accept.

***void* dispose(*Function* callback)**

Executes when the module is about to be replaced.
Callback receives ```data``` object. When the module is reloaded,
this data can be read using ```module.hot.data```.

***String* status()**

Provides the current status of HMR. It will be one of the following:

* ```'idle'``` - Waiting for changes.
* ```'check'``` - Bundler checking for updates.
* ```'prepare'``` - Bundler getting ready to update.
* ```'ready'``` - Bundler prepared updated.
* ```'dispose'``` - ```dispose``` handler on module is being executed.
* ```'apply'``` - ```accept``` handler on module is being executed.

***void* addStatusHandler(*Function* callback)**

Executes when the status of HMR changes.

***void* removeStatusHandler(*Function* callback)**

Removes the listener that matches the callback function.
